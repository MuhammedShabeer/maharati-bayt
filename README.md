## 🚀 The Vision
**Maharati Bayt** (My Skill in My Home) is Qatar's first "Fractional Employment" platform designed to unlock the **Hidden Workforce**. 

We connect highly educated women on family visas—who are currently unemployed—with Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Doha that need professional expertise (Accounting, HR, Design, Admin) but cannot afford full-time sponsorship costs.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Smart Matching:** Connects businesses with talent based on "School Hours" availability (e.g., 8:00 AM - 1:30 PM).
* **Verification System:** Ensures all talent has valid Qatar IDs and University Degrees.
* **Fractional Economy:** Enables "Micro-Contracts" rather than full-time employment, saving visa/flight costs for companies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Current Phase (MVP):** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Custom CSS (Landing Page).
* **Future Phase (SaaS):** * **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)
    * **Database:** SQL Server
    * **Real-Time:** SignalR (for chat/notifications)
    * **Frontend:** Angular / Blazor
